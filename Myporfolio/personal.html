      I am a car enthusiast i enjoy working on cars as much as driving them.<br> When it comes to working on a car i know how do alot.The best thing about this is that i learned by myself. I know how to do basic maintance change a transmission, change a<br> timing belt, an exshaust sytem and much more. I want to pursue a career in the automotive industry. And would like to own a buissness, maybe a shop. Down below<br> i have left a video on how to do an oil change yourself. Maybe by working on your car you find it interesting.
