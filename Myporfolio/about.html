      The first job that i got was when i was 16. Money was tight at home so i decided to start working to maintain myself so my mom wouldnt worry about me.

Well going foward i got a job in a restaurant. I only lasted 3 moths and i decided to leave. A week after that i started working for ups loading trucks.
